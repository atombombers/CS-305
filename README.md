- Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial wished to develop a new banking application. Because they operate in the financial sector, they face a higher risk of cyberattacks, so strong security and careful planning are key priorities for their software needs.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I focused on identifying vulnerabilities early by reviewing the architecture, analyzing code for common security flaws, and making sure best practices were followed to the best of my ability. Good security practices start from the very first line of code and the initial architectural design decisions. From there, it’s up to everyone involved to follow best practices consistently. Today, data breaches make front-page news and can be extremely costly for both users and businesses. Plus, security isn’t a one-time task. All code eventually becomes outdated or reveals new bugs, so building maintainability into the architecture from the start is just as important. In addition, some level of security is legally required, especially when handling sensitive information like personal identifiers or financial data. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I had never performed a static test before, and I believe the most challenging aspect was interpreting the results of the assessment. Knowing how to run a vulnerability assessment and what it looks like 
will be helpful to me in the future, even if I may need further mentoring on interpreting the results.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

The majority of the additions hinged upon input validation. It doesn’t matter whether the input comes from a user, a database, or another system, it should always be treated as untrusted. Input should always be validated and sanitized to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities. In the future, I would continue using strong validation techniques to catch issues early. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure the code and software application were both functional and secure, I ran debug tests throughout to ensure the application ran without errors and after refactoring the code, I ran another vulnerability test to check for new vulnerabilities.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

This class introduced me to Maven, which is a useful tool that is commonly used that I will most likely dabble with again in the future in my classes and beyond.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Project Two was essentially a culmination of every smaller coding assignment into one large project, complete with documentation. I have uploaded the documentation to my GitHub account and would show that to future employers.
